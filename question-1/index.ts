// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let fav_mode_transport:string[]=["Audi car","Aeroplane","Landcruiser","Vitz"]

for(let i=0;i<fav_mode_transport.length;i++){

console.log(`"I would like to own a ${fav_mode_transport[i]}" `)

}
